CAG's Documentation
====================
Corpus Analytics Graph (CAG) serves as an architectural framework for creating graphs, extending them, and analyzing them. 

You can get started :doc:`here </reference/1_get_started>` to see a quick sample on how to *create* a graph from raw data and or extend your graph using our *annotation* framework.

For more details about general CAG concept please visit :doc:`CAG Concept </reference/0_concept>` .

For more details about the CAG' components: :doc:`Graph Creator</reference/2_graph_creator>` and :doc:`Graph Annotator</reference/3_graph_annotator>` .
